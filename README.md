# Breast Cancer Prediction using Neural Networks (Tensorflow 2.x)
The project focuses on developing a model with neural networks and predict whether breast cancer is present or not. This is one of the most important diagnosis in today's world for women.

The project uses Tensorlfow 2 to build the model and do prediction.
